I graduated from Princeton University where I was advised by [Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) and [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/leonard). I've also had the pleasure of collaborating with [Somil Bansal](https://smlbansal.github.io/) at the University of Southern California. 

My research focuses on safety for human-robot interaction. In particular, I'm interested in how we can maintain rigourous guarantees drawn from control theory while reducing overconservativness by allowing robots to learn at runtime. I'm also interested in studying how humans adapt to robots and are influenced over long-term interaction.

<b>I have started my Ph.D. at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute where I am working with [Andrea Bajcsy](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~abajcsy/) on safe human-robot interaction. </b>
