I am a Ph.D. student at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute where I am advised by Prof. [Andrea Bajcsy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abajcsy/). My research leverages the synergy between robust optimal control and generative models
to allow robots to safely operate in unstructured and
uncertain environments. I develop theory and algorithms grounded in systems such as
autonomous vehicles that use learned trajectory forecasters during planning or robotic manipulators that use world models to understand nuanced safety constraints. I am fortunate to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University where I was advised by [Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) and [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/leonard). I've also had the pleasure of collaborating with [Somil Bansal](https://smlbansal.github.io/).
