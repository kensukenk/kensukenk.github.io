Two new papers extending latent safety filters! In [Anysafe](https://any-safe.github.io/) we explore how to parameterized latent safety filters in order to flexibly specify constraints at deployment time. In our [second work](https://cmu-intentlab.github.io/multisafe/) we study temperature-based constraints to investigate how partial observability can degrade the ability of latent safety filters to prevent safety violations. We quantify partial observability in the latent space of self-supervised world models using mutual information and provide a multimodal training strategy for effective filtering even under partial observability!
