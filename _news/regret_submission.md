I submitted my [first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04745) as PhD student at CMU! We derived a new regret metric that automatically identifies prediction errors that induced system-level failures during deployment. Finetuning with only this high-regret data leads to large system-level performance improvements despite only using a small fraction of the total deployment data.
