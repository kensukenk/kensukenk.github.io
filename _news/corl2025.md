Our [new paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.00779) strengthens latent safety filters by allowing them to account for out-of-distribution failures by treating regions where a world model has high uncertainty as a safety violation. This work was lead by [Junwon Seo](https://junwon.me/) and the project website is [here](https://cmu-intentlab.github.io/UNISafe/).
